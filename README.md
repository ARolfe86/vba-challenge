## Module 2 Project: Stock Analysis

For this project, I wrote code to loop through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the that year
* The total stock volume of the stock

In addition, the script returns the stock with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and the greatest total volume. The script runs through all worksheets in the workbook and conditionally formats to highlight the positive changes in green and the negative changes in red. It also sets the proper number format for the percent data values and auto fits the columns to the data size.
